        Banking services provided by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A.,
        Members FDIC. The Chime Visa® Debit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank
        or Stride Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be
        used everywhere Visa debit cards are accepted. The Chime Visa® Credit
        Builder Card is issued by Stride Bank pursuant to a license from Visa
        U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted.
        Please see back of your Card for its issuing bank. By clicking on some
        of the links above, you will leave the Chime website and be directed to
        a third-party website. The privacy practices of those third parties may
        differ from those of Chime. We recommend you review the privacy
        statements of those third party websites, as Chime is not responsible
        for those third parties' privacy or security practices. 1 Chime SpotMe
        is an optional, no fee service that requires a single deposit of $200 or
        more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime Spending Account each
        month. All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account
        up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but
        may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on
        member’s Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount,
        spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be
        displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of
        any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime’s
        discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be
        out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions.
        SpotMe won’t cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers,
        Pay Friends transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. See terms and
        conditions 2 Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing
        of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make
        these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may
        be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date. 3
        Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees apply except at Moneypass ATMs in a
        7-Eleven location or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM. ATM
        withdrawals will be fee-free at all Moneypass ATMs until at least August
        7, 2021. Other fees such as third-party and cash deposit fees may apply.
        4 Based on a representative study conducted by TransUnion®, members who
        started using Chime Credit Builder in September 2019 observed a median
        credit score (VantageScore 3.0) increase of 30 points by January 2020.
        On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score.
        Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. 5 To be eligible
        to apply for Credit Builder, you need to have received a qualifying
        direct deposit of $200 or more to your Spending Account within the last
        365 days of your application. The qualifying direct deposit must have
        been made by your employer, payroll provider, or benefits payer by
        Automated Clearing House (ACH) deposit. Bank ACH transfers, Pay Friends
        transfers, verification or trial deposits from financial institutions,
        peer to peer transfers from services such as PayPal, Cash App, or Venmo,
        mobile check deposits, and cash loads or deposits are not qualifying
        direct deposits. 6 Sometimes instant transfers can be delayed. The
        recipient must use a valid debit card to claim funds. Once you are
        approved for a Chime Spending Account, see your issuing bank’s Deposit
        Account Agreement for full Pay Friends Transfers details. Please see the
        back of your Chime debit card for your issuing bank.See Terms and
        Conditions 7 The Annual Percentage Yield ("APY") for the Chime Savings
        Account is variable and may change at any time. The disclosed APY is
        effective as of August 1, 2021. No minimum balance required. Must have
        $0.01 in savings to earn interest.
